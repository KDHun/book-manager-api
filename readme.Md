### Deploying Your API to Render

We've made it easy to deploy your Book Management API on Render. Follow these simple steps to get your API up and running on the cloud:

1. **Log in to Render:** If you don't have an account, you can create one at [Render](https://render.com/).

2. **Select "Web Service":** After logging in, click the "New" dropdown in the Render Dashboard, then choose "Web Service."

3. **Build and Deploy from a Git Repository:** Select the option to "Build and deploy from a Git repository."

4. **Connect Your Repository:** Choose your preferred source code repository provider, such as GitHub or GitLab. If you haven't connected your account yet, you'll be prompted to do so.

5. **Configuration:**
   - **Name:** Give your Web Service a name.
   - **Runtime:** Select the appropriate runtime for your application (e.g., Node.js, Python, or Docker if you are using a container).
   - **Region:** Choose the geographic region where you want to deploy your API.
   - **Branch:** Specify the Git branch you want to build and deploy from.
   - **Build Command:** Provide the command to build your Web Service. For a Node.js application, this is typically `npm install` or `npm ci`.
   - **Start Command:** Specify the command to start your Web Service. In Node.js, it might be `npm start`.
   - **Plan:** Select the amount of RAM and CPUs your Web Service requires. Choose from the available instance types.

6. **Advanced Settings:**
   - You can specify environment variables, secrets, configure persistent disk, set a health check path, and choose whether or not to auto-deploy on every Git push in the advanced settings. This allows you to customize your deployment as needed.

7. **Create Web Service:** Once you've filled out the required information and adjusted any advanced settings, click the "Create Web Service" button.

8. **Deployment:** Render will automatically build and deploy your API. Once the build is complete, your service will start, and it will be listening on a port.

9. **Access Your API:** You can access your deployed API by visiting the URL provided by Render. Your API will be live and accessible to users.


### Local Setup

To set up and run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
